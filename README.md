# Binary Search Algorithm Analysis (Java GUI)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements the **Binary Search algorithm** using **two approaches**:
- **Iterative Binary Search**
- **Recursive Binary Search**

The application is built with **Java** and includes a **GUI** to compare and analyze the performance of both methods.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main objective of this project is to **analyze and compare the time complexity (Big-O performance)** of iterative and recursive binary search implementations, and determine which approach performs faster under different conditions.

## 🛠 Features
- Binary search using **iterative method**
- Binary search using **recursive method**
- **Java GUI** for user interaction
- Execution time measurement for each approach
- Performance comparison based on search results

## 📊 Analysis
Both algorithms have a theoretical time complexity of **O(log n)**.  
This project focuses on observing **practical performance differences**, such as:
- Function call overhead in recursion
- Execution time differences in real runs

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Java
- Java GUI (Swing / JavaFX)
- Array-based data structure

## 🧠 Conclusion
Although both approaches share the same Big-O time complexity, the implementation allows users to **experiment and observe which method performs faster in practice**.
